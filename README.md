## About
Simplic is a personal project that aims to simplify the architectures of modern computers, all the way from processor, to a basic 3D render program. SimplicCompiler is a simplified compiler for Simplic, which compiles into its own machine code for soft-core SimplicCore. Simplic also comes with its own language, with c-like syntax. Currently, the project is not yet completed.
