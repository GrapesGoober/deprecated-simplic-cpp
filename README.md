# Simplic Assembler
### Author: Nachat K (GrapesGoober)
This branch contains the latest stable version of the assembler. This reads an assembly file and generate a machine code in .hex file, which could then be read by Neeman's Digital ROM module. This is the instructions for the SimplicCore. This is a VS2022 C++ project. There are no external dependencies. Note: the project is built in x64, but if your computer is of a different species, you can always build it yourself :)
