## About The Compiler
Simplic is a series of personal coding projects with the goal of becoming a simplified representation of modern computers, all the way from a series of logic gates, to a soft-core processor, to a functional programming language, and to a running software, all from scratch. Every part of this project is meant to be a simplified analogy of their respective counterparts.

SimplicCompiler, which started in December 2022, is a project under Simplic. It is a simplified compiler written in C++, which parses a unique C-like language simply called Simplic, into its own unique machine code (in hex file) to be used for SimplicCore. Its main goal is to be reduced, simplified, and readable, while maintaining the functionality to be analogous to other compilers.

## About The Language
Simplic language is also intended to be reduced and simplified, while also maintaining a similar syntax to most languages (to be readable by most people and be analogous to other programming languages). The syntax is inspired by Golang, with its simplified nature of C, and so Simplic also has a C-like syntax.
